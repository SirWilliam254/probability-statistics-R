- Bernoulli

A Bernoulli trial is an experiment with only two outcomes. i.e success or failure
- Binomial

 Binomial random variable X is more like n
independent and identical Bernoulli trials in which the probability of a success
is p, 0 < p < 1. i.e  X ∼ B(n, p)

- Geometric

 Suppose that a sequence of independent and identical Bernoulli trials, each
having probability of success p, 0 < p < 1, are performed until a success is
observed. If X denotes the number of failures obtained prior to the first success,
then X is said to be a geometric random variable.

- Negative Binomial

Suppossing that a sequence of independent and identical Bernoulli trials, each
having probability of success p," where 0 ≤ p ≤ 1", are performed until r successes are
observed. If X denotes the number of failures obtained prior to getting the rth success,
then X is said to be a negative binomial random variable.

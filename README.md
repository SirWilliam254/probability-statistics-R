Suppossing that a sequence of independent and identical Bernoulli trials, each
having probability of success p," where 0 ≤ p ≤ 1", are performed until r successes are
observed. If X denotes the number of failures obtained prior to getting the rth success,
then X is said to be a negative binomial random variable.
